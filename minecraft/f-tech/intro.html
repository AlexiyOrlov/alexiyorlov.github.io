  <h1>F-Tech mod</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the F-Tech information page. Here you will the find necessary info to progress in the mod. If you have JEI,
  you can view recipes from this mod.</p>

  <h2 class="header">Starting</h2>
  <p class="important">Most items from this mod require titanium to make. Production of titanium is a complex process with multiple
  steps requiring several resources.</p>
  <p class="important">You will need to gather several minerals: quartzite, limestone, dolomite, halite and ilmenite. They can be
      found between -30 - 120 height in the world.</p>
  <h3>Quartzite</h3>
  <p>It's a mineral needed to make silica bricks that are used to build several structures in the mod. It is also
  used in production of ferrosilicon that is needed to make magnesium.</p>
  <h3>Limestone</h3>
  <p>It's a mineral used in production of steel.</p>
  <h3>Halite</h3>
  <p>Halite is a salt mineral, used to produce chlorine.</p>
  <h3>Dolomite</h3>
  <p>Used to produce ferrosilicon.</p>
  <h3>Ilmenite</h3>
  <p>Ilmenite is a mineral containing titanium. It needs processing.</p>

  <h3>Coke</h3>
  <p>Coke is needed in production of steel. It can be made in the coke furnace only from coal.</p>

  <h2 class="header">Structures</h2>
  <p>Several functional blocks in this mod are multiblocks - they require a structure to be built to function.
  When you place the main block, it will show a transparent preview of blocks needed to be placed around it. If a block
  placed is invalid, it will show a red cube. When the structure is complete, you will hear 2 beeps. If a structure
  becomes incomplete, you will hear 2 rough beeps.</p>
  <h3>Multiblock proxy</h3>
  <p>Proxy is a block that interfaces with the main block for item, energy and fluid handling. It means you can insert
  and extract them through this block.</p>

  <h3>Coke furnace</h3>
  <p>Produces coke from the coal.</p>

  <h3>Fine blast furnace</h3>
  <p>Used to make ferrosilicon, magnesium and steel.</p>
  <img src="Fine%20blast%20furnace.png" alt="Fine blast furnace">

  <h3>Forge</h3>
  <p>Used to heat up iron and steel for use in smithing. It takes time for the forge to heat up. The higher
    the temperature, the faster ingots are heated up.</p>
  <img src="Forge.png" alt="Fine forge">

  <p class="important">You will need steel in crafting some items and building structures. You can make steel tool set
  from it in the fine anvil.</p>

  <h2 class="header">Functional blocks</h2>
  <h3>Fine anvil</h3>
  <p>Used to make metal plates and steel blocks from the hot ingots. You need to arrange hot ingots in the grid to make
  them, then you need some strikes with a hammer on the anvil to make them.</p>

  <h3>Hammer</h3>
  <p>Hammer is needed for metalworking in the anvil. Use it to strike on the anvil. A bar on the screen will show
    crafting progress.</p>

  <p class="important">Next step is processing raw ilmenite into titanium slag. It is done in the ore thermal furnace.</p>

  <h3>Ore thermal furnace</h3>
  <p>This block makes titanium slag from the ilmenite. It can also smelt metals a second faster than the vanilla blast
    furnace.</p>
  <img src="Ore%20thermal%20furnace.png" alt="Ore thermal furnace">

  <p class="important">You need to produce chlorine from salt. First use a mixer to make brine, then process it in the
  electrolyzer.</p>

  <h3>Mixer</h3>
  <p>Used to make brine from the salt chunks. You need to fill it with water and supply energy.</p>

  <p class="important"> Energy can be produced
    in the combustion generator. It is the simplest generator.</p>

  <h3>Electrolyzer</h3>
  <p>Electrolyzer extracts chlorine from the brine. Supply brine through the left proxy. Supply energy through the back
    proxy. Chlorine will be deposited into the right gas tank.</p>
  <img src="Electrolyzer.png" alt="Electrolyzer">

  <p class="important">When you made chlorine and titanium slag, you can process them in the fluid reactor to make
  titanium tetrachloride.</p>

  <h3>Fluid reactor</h3>
  <p>Used to make titanium tetrachloride, which is then used to make titanium ingots. Input fluid tank must be placed
   in the bottom center.</p>
  <img src="Fluid%20reactor.png" alt="Fluid reactor">

  <p class="important">Now you need to make magnesium. First make ferrosilicon in the fine blast furnace, then make
  magnesium from it. When you got magnesium, you can now process it in the fluid reactor with titanium
  tetrachloride to make titanium ingots.</p>

  <p class="important">Next you will need 3D printer to make other items from this mod. To make 3D printer, you will need to make
  tempered glass from the regular glass. Once you made the printer, you will need to supply it with energy through
  the back proxy.</p>
  <h3>3D printer</h3>
  <img src="3D%20printer.png" alt="3D printer">

  <h2 class="header">Items</h2>
  <h3>Drainer</h3>
  <p>This item deletes liquids on right click. It is powerful, because water and lava frequently hide resources and
  inhibit movement.</p>

  <h3>TNT gun</h3>
  <p>Can throw ignited TNT.</p>

  <h3>Spawner transporter</h3>
  <p>Another powerful item that stores a spawner on right click.</p>

  <h3>Friendly mob container</h3>
  <p>Can store a mob that is not aggressive.</p>

  <h3>Universal mob container</h3>
  <p>Can store any mob.</p>

  <h3>Multitools</h3>
  <p>These combine axe, hoe, pickaxe and shovel functionality.</p>

  <h2 class="header">Other functional blocks</h2>

  <h3>Gas tank</h3>
  <p>Can store gases from this mod. Currently, there is only one gas - chlorine. Right click on it with an item to show
  what it contains.</p>

  <h3>Liquid tank</h3>
  <p>Can store liquids. Right click with an item on it to show what it contains.</p>

  <h3>Tempered glass</h3>
  <p>More blast resistant glass.</p>

  <h3>Food based generator</h3>
  <p>Generates energy from food.</p>

  <h3>Lava based generator</h3>
  <p>Generates energy from lava.</p>

  <h3>Biofuel based generator</h3>
  <p> Generates energy from plant matter. Biofuel value of the item is shown in the tooltip.</p>

  <h3>Honeycomb based generator</h3>
  <p>Generates energy from honeycombs.</p>

  <h3>Pump</h3>
  <p>Pumps liquids. Has configurable range. Needs pump pipes to reach the liquid below.</p>

  <h3>Miner's TNT</h3>
  <p>Destroys mundane blocks without drops and doesn't break ores. Doesn't damage entities.</p>

  <h3>Drill controller</h3>
  <p>Uses drills to break blocks and store their drops. Drills need to be placed adjacent to each other and one of them
  needs to touch the drill controller. Put drill bits into the drill controller, place an item container adjacent to it,
  supply energy and activate it with the button. When finished, drill controller can be broken without losing its
  drill bits.</p>

  <h3>Box tiers 1, 2, 3</h3>
  <p> An explosion resistant item container.</p>

  <h3>Teleporter</h3>
  <p>Used to teleport players to other teleporters. You can set a teleporter to be private or public. Needs energy.</p>

  <h3>Crop harvester</h3>
  <p>Harvests and replants crops in a 9x9 area.</p>

  <h3>Tree harvester</h3>
  <p>Harvests trees in a 9x9 area.</p>

  <h3>Mixer</h3>
  <p>Mixes items with water, currently only used to make brine.</p>

  <h3>Fine Crafting Table</h3>
  <p>This table shows what player can craft with the items in his inventory and allows crafting them.</p>

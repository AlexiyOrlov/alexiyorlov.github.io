    <p>Now, this is a pipe that you can do advanced routing with.</p>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/M23AwuN"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M23AwuN.png"/></a>
    <div>
      Unconfigured pipe behavior:
      <ol>
        <li>Moves inserted item forward, if possible.</li>
        <li>If there's no straight path, moves the item to side direction.</li>
        <li>If there are no side paths, moves the item backwards.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can insert items into pipes by hoppers, droppers, and inserters from other mods.</p>
      If there is a need to retrieve the item from pipe directly, empty hands can do that as well (should I just make a tool for such actions?) - Shift + right click on the pipe.
    </div>
    <h3>Changing general direction of item flow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Hold "Alt" and look at any side of the pipe. It will show current item flow from the side you are looking at, like this:
        <div><a href="https://imgur.com/RmoxH6W"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RmoxH6W.png"/></a></div>
      </li>
      <li>Click on the pipe with empty hands. It will show an interface of item flow map:
        <div><a href="https://imgur.com/SfhT0ZP"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SfhT0ZP.png" /></a></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Customize any direction by pressing appropriate radio button. If I, for example, set item flow from "west" to "up", then western side of the pipe will gain a
        transparent yellow rectangle, indicating that it has a non-default flow:
        <div><a href="https://imgur.com/tjaiPRQ"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tjaiPRQ.png" /></a></div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Blacklisting and whitelisting items</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the pipe GUI and press button "Open Filters". This will show up:
        <div><a href="https://imgur.com/D2nHRZK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D2nHRZK.png" /></a></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        For every pipe side, you can set either a blacklist or whitelist mode, and add up to 9 items by clicking with corresponding items onto appropriate filter slots.
        <div><a href="https://imgur.com/E3UiRWO"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E3UiRWO.png" /></a></div>
        Empty whitelist will block all items from going through. Also there is an option for whitelist to "Hold" or "Pass" matching items, toggled by corresponding buttons on the right; this is for a case when the inventory behind the filter is full. "Hold" will keep the items in the pipe until the inventory has a space for it; "Pass" will allow items to go past the filter.
      </li>
      Pipe's side with non-empty blacklist will get a black transparent rectangle, and a side with a whitelist will gain a white transparent rectangle:
      <p><a href="https://imgur.com/5fGhOtK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5fGhOtK.png" /></a></p>
      <P>Blacklist and whitelist rules are applied before general item flow direction.</P>
      <P>Note that filter will match all items that have equal tags - that means that you don't have to put every type of wooden plank in the filter, just one is sufficient to capture all planks. But you can disable tag filtering in the config.</P> 
    </ol>

	<p> There are three fluids in the mod: Petroleum, Kerosene and Jet Fuel. Petroleum lakes can be found in deserts, badlands and nether. Currently its purpose is to be converted to Kerosene. Kerosene is produced in Petroleum Refinery; it can be processed further in Kerosene Refinery to produce Jet Fuel. Jet Fuel is being used by the Jetpack.</p>
	<p> Only way to transport these fluids are to use Cans and Canisters. Can is an item which can hold 1 block of fluid (1000 units); Canister is a block that can hold 10000 units of fluid. To transport petroleum from its lake to your location, place a canister nearby and fill it using the can on the petroleum blocks. When finished, the canister can be safely broken, because it will save its fluid.</p>
	<p>I might add more uses for these fluids in future - stay tuned.</p>

    <p>Jetpack gives the ability to fly. This implementation is a bit different from other jetpacks. It can't be equipped as an armor; instead, it just needs to be in your inventory to work. There is a hotkey to toggle the jetpack (default is "J"). You can fly very fast with it, and you don't have to worry about fall damage, because the jetpack negates it while is turned on. It uses Jet Fuel, which can be obtained from Kerosene Refinery and filled in using Fluid Filler.</p>

    <div>This is a guide for "Generators". "Generators" is a technical mod, aiming to simplify, alleviate and speed up various activities in the game. Most
      of the blocks and items it adds require energy to operate, but there are exceptions. Currently Generators use energy API "Energies", which is open-source and
      ready for use by other mods.</div>

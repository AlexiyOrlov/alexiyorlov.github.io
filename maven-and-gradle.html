<p>In this article I will tell about my experiences with Gradle and Maven and why I started to prefer Maven over Gradle. I wasn't planning to compare these tools deliberately, but a recent
situation caused me to do it and I felt like sharing my conclusions.</p>

<h1>My initiation to Gradle</h1>
<p>It is highly likely that you know the game Minecraft. I used to play that game a lot. I liked it so much that when I discovered that there are modding tools for it, I wanted to create my
content for it. So I started learning. I had none experience in programming, except a couple of courses in my school. I started to learn Java, because Minecraft is written in it. It was very
difficult for someone with zero experience in real world programming. Way back then (beta times) Minecraft modding tools used some Python scripts for building mods.
    The main and most popular modding kit is called Forge. It was created by some developers to uniform the modding process. I was learning Java and Forge, and was working on my first mods
    in parallel. After some time, I had managed to make and release some of them.</p>
<p>This went for a while. And then the team behind Forge decided to choose Gradle as a build tool for the mods. This forced me to start learning it. Another painful process. After learning
necessary things I was thankful at first for their decision. Yes, using a build tool is more convenient than setting up development environment and stuff manually and using an array of
    scripts. But I didn't know about Maven then, and thus couldn't fairly judge this decision.</p>

<h1>Working with Gradle</h1>
<p>Gradle scripts are written in DSL, which extends from Groovy. Groovy is a dynamically typed JVM programming language. Although it seems attractive at first, code written in it can easily
    become a complex and unmanageable mess, due to various features, syntactic sugar and language "improvements" that are piled up onto each other. No wonder it's not fully supported in
    IDEs nowadays. And Gradle scripts were written exclusively in its DSL language at that time. I learned Groovy in the process, nevertheless, but that knowledge didn't benefit me much.
    Probably, that's why Gradle authors implemented Kotlin scripts later.
</p>
<p>I invested a lot of time into reading Gradle documentation. And a lot of effort to apply gained knowledge to my programming work. I started writing usual applications with Gradle.
I can say that Gradle authors seem to think it's fine to introduce new features and syntax in every version and deprecate previous ones. Their documentation is often lacking in certain
    topics. Which must not be the case for a build tool used by thousands of developers. Let's examine the points of their comparison with Maven (on May of 2020):
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Flexibility - here they say that Google chose Gradle for building Android apps. Android developers know that they must use an "Android Studio" IDE built on Intellij platform.
    I have tried it, and I didn't like it. Mainly because Android development documentation is confusing and conflicting. I barely managed to write a simple image processing app before
    giving up. Gradle contributes to confusion in this area. I'm not competent enough to judge Google's decision, but as a developer I can say that I won't attempt to write any apps for
    Android anymore unless I'm forced to or they choose or invent something better than Gradle.</li>
    <li>Performance - here they tell that Gradle works faster than Maven. While it may be true on benchmarks, consider the time which can be spent on learning Gradle versus learning Maven
    and add it for comparison. I mean, Maven is faster and easier to learn than Gradle, so the total time spent on setting up successful build can be less with Maven. They also mention here
        that Gradle keeps a daemon for speeding up the build, but that's an issue if you have limited memory on your computer.
    </li>
    <li>User experience - here they admit that IDE support is better for Maven. No wonder, because Maven's scripts are usual XML files, while Gradle uses that DSL invention. I wouldn't mind
    it if they kept it consistent among versions instead of changing it almost every time.
    </li>
    <li>Dependency management - "Gradle provides customizable dependency selection and substitution rules", while Maven "allows one to override a dependency, but only by version". I bet
        learning custom rules is another trial of digging their documentation.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>And that's all. Not really attractive if you carefully analyze them.</p>

<h1>Working with Maven</h1>
<p>I finally decided to learn Maven while working on a serious Java project. I couldn't figure out how set up Gradle's tooling API and decided to drop it. I restarted the project, without any
build tool and worked on it for some time. But working on it without a build tool was inconvenient when you switch computers or operating systems, so I decided to try Maven out. I used my IDE
    to convert my generic project into a Maven one; then I found necessary documentation relatively quickly, and applied it to my project. I had to search some info in the internet, but it
was also fast. Fortunately, Maven is conservative when it comes to features and build files - no breaking changes are expected in new versions. Your build script can expand, but you don't
need to change what's already present. The script might be bigger than Gradle's, but you are prevented from turning it into a programmatic mess - just look at some big scripts of popular
    Gradle projects. And it gets worse if the developers don't write comments on what parts of the script do what.
</p>

<h1>In conclusion</h1>
<p>Gradle scripts allow arbitrary code, but it consequently can turn into a mess. They are partially solving this problem by implementing Kotlin scripts, but the fact that they can
change their syntax in any version drives me away.</p>
<p>Some people rightly point out that Gradle is consuming a lot of memory. That is expected from a Java application, though why Maven doesn't have this problem?</p>
<p>Both tools have API for writing plugins. I haven't made any Maven plugins yet, but I made one for Gradle. I'll just say that they are difficult to set up, not even
    talking about documentation.</p>
<p>Both build tools have their areas of expertise. But in my case, I think I will continue to prefer Maven because of its consistency and being easier to learn than Gradle.</p>

    <p>To get started in Forcecraft you will first need to find a Force tree:</p>
    <img src="images/force-tree.png" alt="">
    <p>It will provide you with Force logs and saplings. You can make Force sticks from logs.
    You will also need to find Power ore, which will give you Force gems, which you can use to craft Force ingots.</p>
    <p>First thing you should craft is Force rod. Using the rod you can transmute certain items into others.</p>
    <p>From these materials, you can make Force tools, sword, bow and armor. Some of them have special functions and can be infused in a Force
    insfuser to gain additional properties.</p>
    <h2>Force shears</h2>
    <p>When Force shears are used on a cow, it drops leather; when used on a chicken, it drops feather; when used on a pig, it drops bacon.</p>

    <h2>Force Infuser</h2>
    <p>Force infuser is used to make certain items and to apply infusions to items. It needs Force gems, power and Upgrade tome to work.
    Infusions are split in tiers. Initially, you can apply only tier 0 infusions. You must apply all current tier infusions to get access to
    higher tier infusions.</p>

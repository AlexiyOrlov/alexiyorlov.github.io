<h1>How to generate Minecraft block voxel shapes</h1>
<p>Did you know that you don't have to calculate the shape of the block manually?
There is a plugin for Blockbench called Voxelshape Generators that can generate a block shape from its model.
  Here is how to do it.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the plugin menu (File -> Plugins)</li>
  <li>Search for Voxelshape generators and install it</li>
  <li>Then select File -> Export -> Export voxel shape</li>
  <li>It will create a text file with a Java function that generates a shape for your block</li>
  <li>Use this function in your code.</li>
</ol>

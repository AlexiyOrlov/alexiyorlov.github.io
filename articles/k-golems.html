     <h2>K-Golems overview</h2>
     <p>K-Golems adds a golem that can do several kinds of tasks for automation. These tasks are:</p>
     <ol>

       <li>cut wood</li>
       <li>farm plants</li>
       <li>drop items</li>
       <li>break blocks</li>
       <li>shear</li>
       <li>use item</li>
       <li>breed animals</li>

     </ol>
     <p>Golem crafting recipe:</p>
     <img src="images/golem-recipe.png" alt="">
     <p>These golems have 20 health and can't be directly attacked. To set golem's task, right-click on the golem and press desired task button.
     Then you can set work positions using Position Scepter. Scepter recipe:</p>
     <img src="images/position-scepter-recipe.png" alt="">
     <p>You can store a point position on the scepter by right-clicking a block; and you can store two extra positions by Shift+right clicking
     on blocks. When you hold a scepter, point position will be highlighted with a blue cube in the world, and extra positions will be highlighted
     by yellow cubes. If you look at a golem that has a task while holding a scepter, his work area and positions will be highlighted in the world.
      For some tasks you can make golem filter what items/blocks he will operate on by giving him an Item Filter. Item filter is crafted with
     any kind of coal and paper.</p>
     <h3>Task details:</h3>
     <h4>Item pickup</h4>
     <p>A golem will pick up items in an area specified by extra positions and put it into a block with inventory specified by point position.
     You can give the golem an item filter which will define what items he will pick up.</p>
     <h4>Wood cutting</h4>
     <p>For this task a golem needs an axe. He will cut tree logs within extra positions. If there are no logs to cut, he will go to the
        point position. Golems cut all log blocks in a vertical column, so it is better to grow trees that don't branch out.</p>
     <h4>Plant farming</h4>
     <p>A golem needs a hoe for this. He will break crops, melons, pumpkins, nether warts, sugar cane and replant them within extra
       positions. If there are no plants to harvest, he will go to the point position.</p>
     <h4>Dropping items</h4>
     <p>A golem will take items from a block with inventory specified by starting extra position and drop them at ending extra position. You can
     give him an item filter to specify what items to drop.</p>
     <h4>Block breaking</h4>
     <p>A golem will break blocks within extra positions with an item in his hand, and will go to the point position when there are no blocks.
     You can give the golem a tool, sword or shears for this. You can specify what blocks should he break with an item filter.</p>
     <h4>Shearing</h4>
     <p>A golem will shear shearable entities within extra positions and go to the point position when there are no shearable entities.</p>
     <h4>Using item</h4>
     <p>A golem will use an item in his hand as if right-clicking with it on a block. If extra positions are set, then he will work within the
     extra positions, otherwise the golem will use the item on point position; if both point and extra positions are specified, he will take
     items from the block at point position and use them. You can specify what items to use with an item filter.</p>
     <h4>Animal breeding</h4>
     <p>A golem will breed animals within extra positions with items in his hand and will go to the point position when there are no
     breedable animals.</p>
     <h4>Item transfer</h4>
     <p>A golem will take items from a block at starting extra position and put them into a block at ending extra position. You can define what
       items to tranfer with an item filter.</p>
     <h4>Placing blocks</h4>
     <p>A golem will take blocks from a block at point position and place them within extra positions. You can specify what blocks to place using
     item filter.</p>
    <h3>Energy pylon</h3>
    <p>Golems require upkeep in form of water and energy. You can supply them via energy pylons - put water bottles and food into it and it will
    supply golems within 16 block range.</p>
     <h3>Regeneration pad</h3>
     <p>This mod also adds a block, Regeneration pad, that restores health of entities that walk on it. Regeneration pad must have charge to do
     that. Charge can be added by healing potions - 4 per potion. Recipe:</p>

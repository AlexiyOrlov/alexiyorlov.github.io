    <h2>K-Turrets overview</h2>
    <p>K-Turrets is a Minecraft mod which adds several turrets and combat drones. Turrets protect areas from hostile mobs. Drones work similarly
    to turrets, but are mobile and have lower stats. I will refer to drone or turret as 'unit' if the contextual information applies to both object
    types during the overview.
  </p>
  <p>A unit can be obtained by crafting its respective item. Turret recipes have following pattern - 6 titanium ingots, a dispenser,
     and type-specific ingredient on sides:</p>

  <p>Drone recipes have following pattern - 4 titanium ingots, 2 feathers, a dispenser and type-specific ingredient on sides:</p>

  <p>You can configure a unit via a UI which is accessed by Shift + right click on the unit.</p>
  <img src="unit-ui.png">
  <p>On the left side there is a list of applicable targets, represented by a toggle button with the entity's registry name. On the right side
  there are several controls, integrity (health) indicator and a couple of hints. To remove a target, press on it - it will appear crossed out.
  Once you removed desired targets, close the screen to apply the changes. To add a target, use the text field on top - write full registry name
  and then press 'Add...'button. While you write, a list of suggestions will be displayed below. You can click on a suggestion to copy it into
the text field.</p>
  <p>You can exclude players from targets using the same text field by typing in a player's name prefixed by '!'. Excluded players will appear
     at the top of the target list.</p>
     <p> Pressing 'Dismantle' will eject unit's inventory and drop the unit in item form (its state will be saved). There is
  another button that toggles unit's pushability, and another button which controls whether a unit will attack players who are not allied to you.
   "Claim" button will make a unit yours.</p>
<p>Another button will show up in drone UI which controls whether a drone is following its owner or not.</p>
<p>Dismantling a unit will produce an item that has unit's data written on it; you can see unit's UUID in the tooltip. Using such item
will place that unit and load its data.</p>
<p>If a unit is damaged, you can repair it with a titanium ingot by Shift + right clicking it. Drone recovers 1/4 of integrity from 1 ingot,
   and turret recovers 1/6 of integrity.</p>
   <p>By default unit's targets are all potentially hostile mobs. If you want it to shoot players that are not allied to you, you must add
   "minecraft:player" to targets and toggle the mentioned control button.</p>

   <p>To access unit's inventory, right click it. There you can load it with appropriate ammo.</p>

   <h3>Behavior</h3>
   <p>Turret: if it has ammo (and weapon if it's an Arrow turret), it will shoot at its targets within range.</p>
   <p>Turret can be put into a minecart.</p>
   <p>Drone: same as turret, but will pursue the target. If is set to follow the owner, will fly towards his body. When attacking a mob,
       a drone will move sideways and move back if an attacking mob is too close.</p>
   <p>Drones have less slots for ammo.</p>
   <p>Turrets/drones won't hurt friendly mobs unless they are in the target list.</p>

   <h3>Configuration</h3>
   <p>Each turret type's stats can be configured separately, such as health, range, armor, fire rate, damage. By default, their stats are identical
   except damage; turrets ranked by damage, from lowest: cobble, firecharge, arrow, bullet, brick, gauss. </p>
   <p>Turret default values:</p>
   <p>Health = 60</p>
   <p>Armor = 3</p>
   <p>Range = 32</p>
   <p>Fire rate = 20</p>
   <p>Drones' stats are derived from appropriate turrets' stats like this:</p>
   <p>Health = Turret Health - 15</p>
   <p>Range = Turret Range - 5</p>
   <p>Armor = Turret Armor - 2</p>
   <p>Other stats are identical.</p>
   <p>You can turn on drone propeller sound in the client config.</p>
   <p>In the server config (which can be found in "world/serverconfig" directory) there are defined limits of drone and turret count per player.
       A player will not be able to place new drones or turrets if he reaches the limits. Default values are 30 for drones and 50 for turrets.
    </p>
   <h3>Types</h3>
   <p>There are following types of units:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Arrow: can use all kinds of arrows as ammo, and needs bow or crossbow to shoot. Flame, Punch, Power enchantments are applicable by arrow units.</li>

      <img src="cobble-drone.png"><img src="cobble-turret.png">

      <img src="gauss-drone.png"><img src="gauss-turret.png">
   </ol>

   <h3>Tricks and non-obvious info</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Place your turrets on an elevated blocks, so it is harder for melee mobs to reach them.</li>
      <li>Units are immune to poison, wither, hunger, health, health boost and regeneration effects. Others are applicable.</li>
      <li>You can create patrols from turrets in moving minecarts.</li>
      <li>Vanilla team system is accounted by unit targeting.</li>
      <li>Units can't drown.</li>
   </ol>

  <h1>Atheism doesn't make sense</h1>
  <p>
    I want to talk about why, in my opinion, atheism doesn't make sense. Atheists think that there is no God, that all
    that exists is the visible universe, there is no soul, and that humans cease to exist when they die. And humans are
    free to do whatever they want.
  </p>
  <p>If death is our end, then world doesn't make sense. There is no point for it to exist, and for humans to live, because
  in the end everybody will die. There is no meaning of life.</p>
  <p>But consider people who are living unhappy lives, like those born with tough illnesses like cerebral palsy. They are
  incurable and are destined to spend their whole lives with those diseases. Don't you think it would be unfair that it
  was their only fate - to spend one life in such poor state? That's why I believe there's a better life after death.</p>
  <p>Some argue that if God existed, he wouldn't allow such terrible suffering in the world. But humans are creatures that were
  given free will. They choose to inflict suffering on other people, or don't help others to alleviate suffering. Suffering is
  horrible, but it is necessary to make human spirit stronger, straighter and closer to God.</p>
  <p>If there is God, there is life after death, and our earthly life makes sense. We were made to achieve spiritual progress
  through interaction with other people and the world.</p>

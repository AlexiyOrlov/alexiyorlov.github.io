<h1 style="text-align: center">Video game impact on health</h1>
<p>In this article I would like to talk about video games and health. You will receive a first-hand perspective because
    I am a gamer who is suffering gaming-induced problems.</p>
<p>I was introduced to video games in the early age, during early middle school. Me and my mother were visiting her
    friend; that friend had a computer and a son approximately ten years older
    than me. They offered me to play games on that PC. I didn't know what games those were; later I learned that I was
    playing Age of Empires and Counter-Strike. Her son taught me how to play
    them, and I played all the time my mother and her friend were conversing. I remember that I was in awe - I
    discovered something very interesting and got mentally trapped by it. Later I
    begged my mother to buy a PC, because I wanted to play games.</p>
<p>Later I got a game station which you connect to the TV and use game cartridges for playing. I got hooked quickly.
    Games were distracting me from life problems and provided easy enjoyment. Generally, games give you virtual rewards
    <em>quicker and easier</em> than you get rewards in real life. That's
    why they are so attractive. Some of my friends started playing them with me. Eventually they got own game stations,
    too. I remember that I became irritable to objects that interrupted
    me while playing or prevented it, be it people or circumstances.</p>
<p>Some years later my mother bought a PC. It was very expensive for us. It had some games in it, like Half-Life, Prince
    of Persia 3D. Parents
    have bought me some more, including Heroes of Might and Magic 3. This is where stuff started to go wrong. I played
    so much that my grades started to worsen and
    my mother started to notice all this. She tried to control me and forbid playing sometimes. But whenever there was
    nobody home and there was some time I was playing PC games. If I heard
    someone coming into quarter, I just plugged the computer's power cable off so I wouldn't get busted, while feeling
    very scared for doing so, because I was learning well in the school.</p>
<p>Needless to say, such attitude caused the PC to malfunction. It has Windows 98 on it; errors and exceptions were
    piling up in it. That also made me irritable, frustrated and mad.</p>
<p>But do you remember what was going on in Heroes of Might and Magic? Battles with lots of mythical and demonic
    creatures involved. The developers made sure to include as much of them
    as possible in their games. Just remember that fact.</p>
<p>Few years later we changed quarters. Mom's PC was in a bad shape. But me and my friend started visiting computer
    cafes, where you rent the computer for a finite time to do necessary
    things or entertain. We played Counter-Strike, Starcraft, Diablo 2 mainly. Counter-Strike is a well-known game which
    I was never good at but still played it much; it is very stressful for
    mind and promotes swearing and hate towards other players. Diablo means "Devil" in Spanish. Yeah, that's what that
    game was about. Fighting demons to reach the devil and kill him as a boss.
    It doesn't work that way in real life.</p>
<p>So, we spent quite a lot of money on our gaming sessions while coping somewhat with school. I had serious problems
    there: I was weak, maybe the weakest boy in class. And I never had a
    close father figure to support and guide me. I've become shy, cowardly, egoistic, and silently mad at people.</p>
<p>After few years, we changed quarters again. I added Unreal Tournament to my set of games. It's a game where you shoot
    people from various weapons and blast them to pieces sometimes.
    And they shoot you, accompanied with taunting and swearing. That game was so fun for me that I was laughing from
    enjoyment, even when not playing but just thinking about it. I also happened
    to waste some money on trash games, because there was no source of game critique in our environment, and we had no
    Internet connection. I visited my friend and we played games at his home,
    he visited me and played games at my house. By the way, me and my mother bought a new PC, mainly on the money that I
    saved from my grandmother. This time I decided that I will not plug the computer off
    like I did previously. But some plug-offs happened incidentally, and this computer started to malfunction as well
    sometimes. I had no any physical activities or sports; I just went to
    school, did what was necessary and came back. I was in a heavy depression.</p>
<p>Few years later we changed quarters again, but this time I was left to live alone in old quarter, as I grew up. By
    the way, in 9th grade I happened to get sick with some kind of headache
    or migraine. We couldn't determine the cause of it. I finished school finally and was going to study in university.
    I started studying, but then I stopped because the headache was so bad.
    I wanted nothing; I started wanting to die. In 2011 my moral has improved however, thanks to some visits to a
    certain place. I tried working, but nothing much resulted from it. I seeked
    to relieve my headache, and ultimately, ended up with a neurologist who told me that I should apply for disability.
    I agreed and asked my general doctor (I think they are called "GP" in UK)
    about it. For some reason she advised me to apply for disability from a mental side. I went to psychiatrist first
    time in my life. We talked, and he prescribed some stuff for me. He was a
    private one, and after several visits I decided that it was a waste of money and stopped visiting him. This went on
    for a while. In 2014 we did a MRT of the head, but it showed no problems.
    We decided to visit another psychiatrist, and he directed us to the free psychiatric clinic. I went there and
    continued my treatment there. I don't know what my diagnosis was initially.
    Finally, one doctor agreed to send me to apply for a disability.</p>
<p>In our country we have 3 groups of disability, 1st is highest, 3d is lowest. I got 2nd disability group at once. I
    found myself playing Minecraft a lot. I started playing it when it was
    in beta. I liked it, and when I learned that it is possible to mod it, I started learning modding. This is how I
    lived my last years - getting disability, playing games, not working, modding
    Minecraft. And at some day it happened - the psychosis.</p>
<p>My psychosis developed in three days. I was getting increasingly unrest. On the third day, I started to feel as if my
    soul is being torn apart. That feeling is indescribable with words.
    I wanted to die as soon as possible, my hands were shaking, my heart was racing, I couldn't stay in one place for
    few seconds. I was on a brink of making suicide. But I called ambulance,
    and after some painful waiting, I was taken to the central psychiatric clinic. I was shaking. They injected
    something into me, and sent me to a ward to rest. It was ~9 pm. Gradually my
    psychosis went away and I stopped shaking, but I couldn't sleep the night because of a strong headache.</p>
<p>I was released from the clinic 5 weeks later. I stayed with my mom. It seemed to me that that horrendous condition
    has left me. A couple of years went past. Then, I was receiving a
    parcel, and just when I was about to sign the papers, I felt fright and my hand started to shake. I signed the
    papers somewhat and went home and told about the fright to my mother.
    We didn't gave it much attention. But it started to get worse. I was afraid to sign papers; then I started to be
    afraid of other trivial things. Ultimately, I started to be afraid of
    people (~2017). In 2018, I received my disability ID for five years, unlike for one year they did previously. This
    time I found out my diagnosis and it was severe.</p>
<p>Why do I think that video games are bad for mental health? Because they make you (on a mental side) isolated,
    asocial, egoistic, depressed. On a physical side they make you ill, weak,
    contribute to spine illnesses, bad vision, hemorrhoids... Modern games promote violence, disrespect, swearing, bad
    habits, adult topics... Many of them are literally demonic: Doom, Quake,
    Diablo, Elder Scrolls... Games are legal business that deals with big money nowadays. All these streamers,
    youtubers, tournaments, e-"sports", magazines, e-shops where you can buy "loot"
    and merchandise, mods. There are professional studies which show how they affect health.</p>
<p>I feel guilty for wasting so much time and energy on games. I feel guilty for making mods that impacted thousands of
    people and especially children. I am sorry for that and I wish all
    this never happened and I never took part in it. I foresee that gaming will be one of main plagues of humanity.</p>
